i could conduct frame delay by working out the time thats passed between each frame and multiply that by the players pixels per second, using delta time
multiply a deltaTime calculated with the rate at which the player is moving

It is done by calling a timer every frame per second that holds the time between now and last call in milliseconds.
Thereafter the resulting number (delta time) is used to calculate how far, for instance, a video game character would have travelled during that time.


ISSUES I DON'T UNDERSTAND???
    std::fstream mapFile;
    mapFile.open(path);

    for(int y = 0; y < sizeY; ++y){
        for(int x = 0; x < sizeX; ++x){
            mapFile.get(tile);
            //taking a pointer and a pointer passes a reference so we can just take reference...
            Game::AddTile(atoi(&tile), x * 32, y * 32);
            mapFile.ignore(2,',');
        }
        //mapFile.ignore(); odd that this doesn't JUST get rid of the \n at the end
    }
